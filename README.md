This design ensures that web applications will render correctly on a variety of devices with different screen sizes.

## Tools Used
- Bootstrap CSS Framework was primarily used to:
  - Include a navbar
  - Implement a responsive layout with responsive images
  - Minimize the use of media queries
  - Include a grid system with containers, rows and columns

  ## Design
  - On extra small screens, the content will take up the entire screen
  - On small and larger screens, some margins will be viewable on left and right sides of screen
  - An HTML validation service was used to ensure page has a valid HTML
